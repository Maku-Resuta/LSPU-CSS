        <h3>Historical Development</h3>
        <p class="histo">This state institution (LSPU) started from its humble beginnings in 1952. it was first established as a provincial high school known as Baybay Provincial High School, the first public high school established in the shoreline (baybay) district of Laguna de Bay and the second in the whole Province of Laguna. Then in 1957, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1807 on June, 1957, the Baybay Provincial High School was converted into Baybay National Agricultural and Vocational School (BNAVS).<br><br>

            BNAVS became the PACD-BVE Training Center in rice production for American Peace Corps Volunteers. This center produced 682 graduates. The Manpower Training Center Started to operate in the school year 1968-1969. BNAVS also became the pilot school for the 2-year Agricultural Technician Curriculum, Associate in Agriculture. This started in December, 1969 with 8 enrollees.<br><br>
            
            With the passage/approval of HB 269 into law in June 1971: Republic Act No. 6321, it converted BNAVS into Baybay National College of Agriculture and Technology (BNCAT). BNCAT then was offering the following courses:<br><br>
            
            1) Secondary Agriculture Curriculum;<br><br>
            
            2) Two-year Associate in Agriculture (technical course);<br><br>
            
            3) degree courses leading to Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (2nd Semester 1975-76), and Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Education (First Semester 1977-78).<br><br>
            
            The College was also one of the Experimental Agricultural High Schools (EAHS) selected by the Educational Development Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF) under Presidential Decree No. 6-A, to receive World Bank Aid in terms of infrastructure, equipment, and staff development.<br><br>
            
            This state institution was a grantee of the Agricultural Education Outreach Project (AEOP) from 1980 to 1983. AEOP was a research project of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Research programs became more prioritized and government extension programs became more aggressive.<br><br>
            
            On June 10, 1983 by virtue of Batas Pambansa No. 482, BNCAT was further converted into a state college, known as the Laguna State Polytechnic College. From then on the Laguna State Polytechnic College grew bigger and better, with the incumbency of Dr. Ricardo A. Wagan as the first College President in 1986, several projects and infrastructure developments poured in to LSPC. Among the remarkable accomplishments then were as follows:<br><br>
            
            In 1993, this state institution was designated by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) as one of the seven (7) Provincial Technical Institutes of Agriculture (PTIAs) in Region IV under the Aus-AID-AGRITECH Project aimed at improving the curriculum, instructional programs and the development of practical and applied researches.<br><br>
